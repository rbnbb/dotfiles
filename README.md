# dotfiles
Personal basic dotfiles
## Usage:
When on a new machine with access to internet:
 - clone this repo into your home directory
 - make sure the machine has vim and zsh
 - install oh-my-zsh and its powerlevel10k theme with the script (to-do)
 - run make.sh to copy the new dotfiles in their place
 - ENJOY !
